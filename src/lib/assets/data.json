It is in these snapshots of time that we muster the courage to take flight, transcend the ordinary, and unfurl our dreams against the boundless sky.\r\n\r\nIn an era where every moment holds the power to tell stories that words cannot convey, Bryan Rallos, a Taga-West alumnus from Himamaylan City Campus, stands out not just for his ability to capture images, but for his gift in telling tales without uttering a single word.\r\n\r\n𝗥𝗼𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗸\r\n\r\nRallos' journey into photography began not with a camera in hand, but with a promise in his heart. It started during his elementary years, when he watched a classmate, who was a student journalist at the time, freeze moments with a camera. Although he wasn't able to wield one himself back then, he swore that one day, he would be the person behind the lens.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until his years as a senior high student that Rallos' fascination with photography resurfaced and allowed him to turn it into a hobby. With nothing but an old Android phone to capture photos of his classmates, Rallos began to understand the unique language that the art of photography speaks.\r\n\r\nDuring the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Rallos took time to learn more about photography. With the help of his cousins, they would do photoshoots for fun, and he enjoyed every moment of it.\r\n\r\nDespite his clear interest in multimedia arts, Rallos pursued a degree in education, with a major in English. Although it wasn't in line with his current craft, it did not mean the end of his photographic journey, because eventually, he became a freelance photographer.\r\n\r\n𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝗮𝘂𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴\r\n\r\nFor Rallos, photography has become a passion and a means of self-expression, as it heals him every time he translates his thoughts into beautiful photographs.\r\n\r\nThe adrenaline rush he feels while holding a camera is matched only by the satisfaction of creating images that tell stories aligning with his creative vision as an artist.\r\n\r\n“Storytelling is one of the keys to an effective image. You are providing doors for viewers to interpret your work and lead them to stories that sometimes differ based on their personal experiences—and that’s the beauty of storytelling,” he shared.\r\n\r\nFor him, the culture one is exposed to deeply influences their craft. In his case, the dreamy quality of his photos is a signature style. He also often seeks out new faces and models to capture diverse visuals and reflect their unique personalities through his lens.\r\n\r\n𝗛𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗼𝗻𝗲'𝘀 𝗰𝗿𝗮𝗳𝘁\r\n\r\nDuring his college years, time management was among Rallos’ biggest challenges. Balancing his roles as a freelance photographer, student leader, and member of the student publication demanded a great deal of effort.\r\n\r\nDespite the exhaustion, it was fulfilling to see the significant growth he experienced through these endeavors. “As long as I’m happy, enjoy what I’m doing, and it pays my bills, that’s all that matters to me,” he said.\r\n\r\nAlthough he doesn’t see teaching as a career path, Rallos is currently reviewing for the boards, believing that obtaining the license will benefit him in the future. Once licensed, he plans to explore opportunities in multimedia arts and hopes to join media and production companies as well as the creative commercial industry.\r\n\r\n𝗕𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀\r\n\r\nRallos envisions a lifetime dedicated to his passion, aiming to broaden his market and visibility. He dreams of one day owning a studio and contributing to major campaigns and magazines globally.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what advice he would give to his younger self, Rallos said, “Have patience. Things may seem a bit blurry now, but trust the process and savor every step. You're bound for bigger and greater things.”\r\n\r\nAfter all, to dream is to have wings, lifted by the sheer force of one's hopes and ambitions. One day, Rallos, the dreamer, will look back at the photos he has taken—each one a shimmering fragment of his journey, capturing moments of what once was and reflecting the person he has become.\r\n\r\nStory by Marionn Jed Bernas and Verna Crissa Villorente\r\nDesign and layout by Justin Kyle Quinesio\r\nPhoto courtesy of Bryan Rallos",

Ledesma, Alorro, and Calix were recruited to complete the team, with Ledesma serving as the project manager and the others contributing their unique artistic and technical skills.\r\nFueled by their love for games such as Minecraft and Roblox, they decided to create their own and join game developing competitions. \r\n“We wanted to gain experience in developing games within a limited time frame and pitching them on stage,” shared Cabales.\r\nFor the Odyssey, they developed “Pacmania: Chomp and Brawl,” a revamped game that merges the classic arcade hits Pac-Man and Mortal Kombat, featuring a unique 1v1 mode split into “Labyrinth” and “Brawl Fight.”\r\nThis reimagining aims to blend nostalgic elements with enhanced strategic play, offering a fresh experience for both Pac-Man fans and competitive gamers. \r\nDuring their freshman year, the team also released “Visayan Sojourn,” an alchemy-based cooking game on Android through the Google Play Store last April.\r\nThe Visayan Voyagers want their games to be a source of joy for the people, as they believe that games are created mainly for fun and entertainment.\r\n𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝘂𝗿𝗱𝗹𝗲𝘀\r\nCreating games presented its fair share of challenges for The Visayan Voyagers. Time management emerged as a crucial issue, as the team struggled to balance academic responsibilities with the demanding nature of game development.\r\n“We didn’t really have proper management in developing those games,” Cabales admitted. But despite these hurdles, the team managed to pull through in the final stages of development.\r\nFor Calix, venturing into pixel art for “Pacmania” was a memorable challenge, as it was his first foray into the artistic medium. Meanwhile, Alorro, who is responsible for the game's promotional material, struggled with an art block during the summer vacation but managed to find inspiration and complete the work. \r\nOn the other hand, Ledesma emphasized the difficulty of meeting deadlines and the importance of effective task management tools like Trello to keep the project organized and on schedule. \r\n“It is hectic to balance schoolwork and academic life with competitions. You need to squeeze every bit of energy just to finish,” Ledesma shared.\r\n𝗔 𝗯𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗳𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲\r\nThe Visayan Voyagers' adventure in game development has been a journey of growth and discovery. Through their experiences, they have gained profound insights into the nuances of team dynamics, the importance of assigning roles effectively, and the art of balancing time and vision throughout the project lifecycle.\r\nThey hope that their story will inspire other students to pursue their passions and embrace the challenges that come with it. They are eager to participate in future hackathons and make their mark across multiple domains of the tech industry, including digital art and other innovative fields.\r\n“Try and try; there are no losses, only wins and lessons,” advised Ledesma to aspiring game developers. The team also recommends familiarizing oneself with game engines for effective programming.\r\n“Losing is normal, and sometimes things are outside of our control. Make [every] loss your motivation,” Cabales added.\r\nWhat the future holds for them is yet to be seen, but the team is set to sail onto brighter and broader horizons. \r\nThe Visayan Voyagers will continue to blaze trails, proving that dreams are within reach for those who dare to pursue them.\r\nStory by Verna Crissa Villorente \r\nLayout by Yshi Mei Pomarejos\r\nDesign by Justin Kyle Quinesio\r\nPhotos courtesy of Little Eye",

Villaruz, or “Doc Bebong” to his family, friends, and colleagues, holds this vision as the eighth president of West Visayas State University (WVSU).\r\nIn a profession that demands both intellect and compassion like medicine, achieving exemplary stature remains a rare feat, and Doc Bebong is among the few who embody this rarity. Recognized as one of the 2024 Dr. Jose Rizal Memorial Awardees, Doc Bebong exceptionally emulates the ideals of the national hero in his life, practice, and service.\r\n𝗣𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗻 𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿\r\nUnknown to some, Doc Bebong’s dreams set sail on the vast ocean, imagining life as a seafarer as a child. It was only in high school that he began envisioning a future in medicine. His vision of contributing to positive change soon flourished at the University of the Philippines Visayas, where he completed his degree in Biology.\r\nIn his second year at WVSU, a spark ignited by his teachers guided him toward pediatrics. Pediatricians, he believes, are “doctors with a very keen sense and acute clinical skills.” This specialty molded him to always see the bigger picture, shaping him into an effective leader and manager. \r\nDoc Bebong’s career peaked when he assumed the role of officer-in-charge president from November 2013 to May 2014. Despite the brevity of his tenure, he left an indelible mark on the University, paving the way for his appointment as president of WVSU in 2019.\r\n𝗜𝗻 𝗽𝘂𝗿𝘀𝘂𝗶𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗲𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲\r\nInitially, Doc Bebong saw the deanship of the University’s College of Medicine as the zenith of his career. However, as he ascended to the presidency, he uncovered deeper layers of purpose and expectations.\r\n“To assume such a position also satisfies an individual’s hunger for self-actualization,” he explained.\r\nDespite facing challenges that tested his abilities, Doc Bebong remained steadfast, believing that while certain obstacles are beyond control, his response always exemplified his best efforts and an acceptance of circumstances.\r\nFor Doc Bebong, his latest achievement stands as the pinnacle of his career, a testament to his dedication to the medical field and the academe. He sees his recent distinction as a beacon of excellence, driving his commitment to service and continuous improvement.\r\n𝗕𝗲𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝘀𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗳𝘂𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝗻\r\nWith all great achievements, one might wonder what lies beneath it all. In Doc Bebong’s story, his wife has been the most influential person—his go-to person in times of self-doubt and critical decisions. \r\nHe also cherishes the birth of his first grandchild as the most meaningful moment in his life, saying, “I appreciate now why we exist, why we are living, [and] the continuity of life.”  \r\nWhen asked about the secret to choosing the right path, Doc Bebong emphasized the need for focus, drive, and motivation. \r\n“Life is all about choices. No amount of challenge can prevent an individual from achieving his or her dreams,” he stated.\r\nThe future may be uncertain, but the University president’s promise remains clear: to push beyond the ordinary in his pursuit of service and excellence, ensuring that WVSU remains as a beacon of quality education, research, and leadership.\r\nStory by Verna Crissa Villorente\r\nDesign by Justin Kyle Quinesio\r\nLayout by Keminova Acepcion\r\nPhoto courtesy of West Visayas State UniversityFacebook",
